## Recipes App

This project was developed at the end of block 18, where we produced a recipe app in a group. I had the pleasure of working with [Mylena Almeida](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mylena-almeida/), [HÃ©lio Souza](https://www.linkedin.com/in/helio-souza-09b991b9/), and [Gustavo Cabral](https://www.linkedin.com/in/guscabraal/).

### How it works
The most important features of this project are:
1. To use two APIs, one for drinks and another for food.
2. Tests that cover 90% of the hole application.
3. Style a page that has dimensions of 360 x 640.
4. Save in the localStorage the made and favorites recipes.
